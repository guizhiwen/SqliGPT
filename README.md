# SqliGPT

Welcome to the SqliGPT repository! This project is dedicated to enhancing SQL Injection detection and prevention using advanced machine learning techniques. SqliGPT is a groundbreaking approach that leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models to understand and predict SQL injection patterns more accurately.

## Overview

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a prevalent security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and most dangerous web application vulnerabilities. SqliGPT aims to tackle this challenge by using Large Language Models to analyze and predict SQLi attacks.

## Benchmark

As part of our commitment to transparency and collaboration, we have released our Benchmark. This benchmark is based on sqli-labs, and we also referenced five real-world CVEs from SQIRL's SQLiMicroBenchmark[1].

### Getting Started

To get started with SqliMicroBenchmark, clone this repository and navigate to the `SqliMicroBenchmark` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guizhiwen/SqliGPT.git
cd SqliGPT/SqliMicroBenchmark
```

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the `SqliMicroBenchmark` directory to set up and run the tests.

## Future Work

The full source code of SqliGPT will be released in the upcoming months. We are currently refining the model and conducting extensive testing to ensure its effectiveness and robustness. Stay tuned for updates!
